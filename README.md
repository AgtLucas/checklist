# The Haskell performance checklist

You have a Haskell program that's not performing how you'd like. Use
this list to check that you've done the usual steps to performance
nirvana.

* [Are you compiling with -Wall?](#are-you-compiling-with--wall)
* [Are you compiling with `-O` or above?](#are-you-compiling-with--o-or-above)
* [Have you run your code with the profiler?](#have-you-run-your-code-with-the-profiler)
* [Have you setup an isolated benchmark?](#have-you-setup-an-isolated-benchmark)
* [Have you looked at strictness of your function arguments?](#have-you-looked-at-strictness-of-your-function-arguments)
* [Are you using the right data structure?](#are-you-using-the-right-data-structure)
* [Are your data types strict and/or unpacked?](#are-your-data-types-strict-andor-unpacked)

* [Have you considered compiling with LLVM?](#have-you-considered-compiling-with-llvm)

## Are you compiling with -Wall?

GHC warns about type defaults and missing type signatures:

* If you let GHC default integers, it will choose `Integer`. This is
  [10x slower](https://github.com/haskell-perf/numbers#numbers) than
  `Int`. So make sure you explicitly choose your types.
* You should have explicit types to not miss something obvious in the
  types that is slow.

## Are you compiling with `-O` or above?

By default GHC does not optimize your programs. Cabal and Stack enable
this in the build process. If you're calling `ghc` directly, don't
forget to add it.

Enable `-O2` for more optimizations.

## Have you run your code with the profiler?
