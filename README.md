# The Haskell performance checklist

You have a Haskell program that's that performing how you'd like. Use this list to check that you've done the usual steps to performance nirvana,

0. Are you compiling with -Wall? 
0. Did you compile with `-O` or above?
0. Have you run your code with the profiler? 
0. Have you setup an isolated benchmark? 
0. Have you looked at strictness of your function arguments? 
0. Are you using the right data structure? 
0. Are your data types strict and/or unpacked?
0. Did you check your code isn't too polymorphic? 
0. Do you have an explicit export list?
0. Have you looked at the Core?
0. Have you considered unboxed arrays/strefs/etc? 
0. Are you using Text or ByteString instead of String?
0. Have you considered compiling with LLVM?
